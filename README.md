# Sorting Hat Bot for Slack

Want to quickly sort yourself into a Hogwarts House on Slack? Think that friend is really a Slytherin not a Gryffindor, but want a little magical confirmation from a sentient hat? Just use the `/sortinghat` slash command! Type your the slash command followed by a name of the witch or wizard to be sorted. Sorting Hat bot responds with a short rhyme and the banner of the selected House.

## About HTTP Status Cats

Internet is made of cats, so why not HTTP Status codes, explained with cats?

Originally, HTTP Status Cats was created by yours truly, **me** in 2011!
It is best described on [Know Your Meme](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/http-status-cats).

I would never imagined I had such a 10-min fame at that time I created and posted the cat pics on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/girliemac/sets/72157628409467125/). I was immediately featured on Boing Boing, Mashables, CNN Tech, BuzzFeed, and many more including international tech news etc. Especially, I loved that [Boing Boing](http://boingboing.net/2011/12/14/http-status-cats-by-girliemac.html) said I "just won the internet".

A good time.

HTTP Status Cats are later well-adopted by communities, and evolved into many APIs and apps, especially HTTP Status Cats API and its awesome domain, **http.cat** by [RogÃ©rio Vicente](https://twitter.com/rogeriopvl). The page is also available in Catalan language, as its TLD shows!
