# Sorting Hat Bot for Slack

Want to quickly sort yourself into a Hogwarts House on Slack?
Think that friend is really a Slytherin not a Gryffindor, but want a little magical confirmation from a sentient hat?

Just use the `/sortinghat` slash command! Type your the slash command followed by a name of the witch or wizard to be sorted. Sorting Hat bot responds with a short rhyme and the banner of the selected House.

## About Sorting Hat

I have no official connection to JK Rowling or any other Harry Potter rights-holding organization. This is simply a bit of fan art.
